Cloning There are so many instances!
"
Fork it <---- create a road to your version (with a path to the original just in case you want to compare the original)
Clone it <----Make an exact copy in your acccount
Remote it <-----create a relationship between your computer file and the github.com files
Edit it  <--- make your edits locally (open a text file and save it in the folder)
Add it <------ give it to your git rocket launcher (the commandline commander)
push it <---- push it to the cloud!
commit it <------- review changes - look good, commit! put a ring on it!

"Create new repository" == Create a new project or folder

Working with others or different versions of yourself
"Create a new branch" == Create a new copy to make experimental changes

"Oops go back" == experiment failed -> delete branch or go back to original

""

push? WHy is it a hash? 
each individual hash will look like a blockchain - a hashed chain of events where each block is a commit!
